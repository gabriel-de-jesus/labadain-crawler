# Labadain Crawler


## Overview

Labadain crawler is a data collection pipeline designed to optimize the process of constructing comprehensive textual corpora from the web. The system is built on top of the Apache Nutch framework and incorporates language-specific components such as a tokenizer and a language identification model.


## Requirements

### Technical requirements
- [ ] Apache Nutch.
- [ ] Apache Solr.

### Language specific requirements
- [ ] An initial text corpus containing the target language.
- [ ] A tokenizer.
- [ ] A language identification model.


## Getting started

- [ ] Create a project folder and name it `crawler-home`.
- [ ] Navigate into the project folder and install `pip`, create a virtual environment (here we use `pipenv`), and activate it.
- [ ] Install `git` and clone the source code of the pipeline:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/humanise/_imis/tetun-ir/tetun-crawler-pipeline.git

```

- [ ]  Install the dependencies specified in the Pipfile.

```
pipenv install --dev
```


## Apache Nutch and Solr Setup

To set up Apache Nutch and Solr, follow these steps:

- [ ] **Download Apache Nutch and Solr:** download the Apache Nutch and Solr packages and save them to the **crawler-home** directory. Ensure that you download the appropriate version compatible with your system.

- [ ] **Configure Apache Nutch:** refer to the [Nutch installation and configuration tutorial](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTCH/NutchTutorial) for detailed instructions on configuring Nutch. Follow the tutorial, but skip the **Crawl your first website** section and proceed directly to the **Setup Solr for search** section.

- [ ] **Rename the Nutch and Solr packages:** after downloading the packages, rename the Nutch package directory from `apache-nutch-1.x` to `nutch` and the Solr package directory from `apache-solr-9.x` to `solr`.

- [ ] **Verify the Nutch and Solr configuration:** after completing the configuration steps, verify that both Nutch and Solr are working correctly. You can do this by following the verification steps provided in the tutorial.


## Pipeline Setup

To set up the pipeline, you will need to organize the following main folders in the specified structure:

- [ ] **bin**: this folder contains a bash file that allows configuration of seeder iterations and crawling rounds.
- [ ] **pipeline**: this folder contains include the codes for configuration, seeder, corpus construction, and corpus summary generation. It also contains the lid, data, and log folders.
- [ ] **nutch**: it contains the Nucth framework files.
- [ ] **solr**: it contains the Solr framework files.


### Create folders and copy the LID model and initial corpus

- [ ] Create the LID, data, and log folders within the pipeline folder. 
- [ ] Copy the LID model, name it `lid_model.pkl`, and locate it in the **lid** folder. 
- [ ] Copy the initial corpus, name it `initial_corpus.txt`, and locate it in the **data** folder.

`[Optional]`

If you want to use the module to generate a data sample for evaluation purposes, you can create an additional folder inside the **data directory** and name it `evaluation_sampl`. This folder will be used to store the generated data sample.


### Module Configuration

In the configuration folder, you will find the general pipeline configuration located in **pipeline/conf/config.yaml**. This configuration module consists of the following components:


- [ ] **files:** This section contains files that are either required by the pipeline or will be generated by the pipeline.
- [ ] **paths:** This section contains paths that are either required by the pipeline or will be generated by the pipeline.
- [ ] **params:** The configurations in this group and the following sections can be adjusted according to your specific requirements. This includes settings related to Solr, language processing, LID model, corpus used by the pipeline, and extensions.


### LID Model Configuration

To configure the language identification (LID) model in the pipeline, follow these steps:

- [ ] Open the file **pipeline/common_utils/tetun_lid.py**.
- [ ] Locate the `get_tetun_text`function within the file.
- [ ] Adjust the function according to the nature of your LID model.
- [ ] **Ensure that the function receives a list of strings as input.** This is important for optimizing the corpus construction process and making it faster. Make the necessary modifications to the `get_tetun_text` function based on your LID model's requirements.


## Pipeline Execution

To execute the pipeline and initiate the crawling process, follow these steps:

- [ ] On the `crawler-home` directory, run the bash file named `crawler.sh`using the following command:

```
$ bash ./bin/crawler.sh
```

Running this command will execute the pipeline and automatically start the crawling process. Please ensure that you are in the correct directory before executing the command, as the path `./bin/crawler.sh` should be relative to the current working directory.
